- Simulations: Contain all necessary codes to reproduce the results of S1-S6 simulation.
- Realdata: Contain all necessary codes to reproduce the results BHL,EEG, malariaDBLaNetworks2013, UNcomtrade.
  - For BHL, one might need to downlaod the original dataset using the "BHL-preprocessing.R" file or through https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS1083. 
  - For EEG, one needs to download the original dataset from the UCI database https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/121/eeg+database.
  - For malariaDBLaNetworks2013, the data is collected by Daniel Larremore. See "README.txt" in the malariaDBLaNetworks2013 file.
  - For UNcomtrade, the data is collected from https://comtrade.un.org.
